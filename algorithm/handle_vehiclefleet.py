This file should handle the vehicle fleet. This includes:
- Initializing new vehicles when the start shift (vehicle object). It is assumed that the vehicle is at the depot of the region at the time when the shift starts.
- Add new vehicle to fleet of corresponding region (every region has a list of its vehicles currently available)
- The attribute when a vehicle stops working still has to be added to the object and the algorithm
